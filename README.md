# Body-Pose-Detection
First of all it is a basic project having currently one posture algorithm to detect.
But you can make different posture algorithms and can add to the existing program.
Using Open CV and mediapipe , the program is detecting body pose by drawing landmarks on the specific parts of the body.
Using computer vision and machine learning.
The program captures video from a camera, detects key body landmarks, and calculates the angle of joints like the elbow. 
Based on the movement of these joints, it counts repetitions of exercises like bicep curls.
